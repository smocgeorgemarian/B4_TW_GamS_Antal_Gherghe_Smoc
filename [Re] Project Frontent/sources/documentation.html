        <h3 role="doc-subtitle">1.1 Purpose</h3>
        <p>The following SRS describes an HTML/CSS/JavaScript architecture used for creating the FrontEnd side of the
            project "GamS (Gamification as a Service)", as well as Node.JS architecture used for BackEnd and APIs. The
            current iteration has release number 1.3.1.</p>

        <h3 role="doc-subtitle">1.4 Product Scope</h3>
        <p>The software specified is a gamification service used by web developers and site owners to add rewards
            granted to users for doing specified tasks or actions and add a leveling system. The benefits of this
            service are on a marketing level to motivate and engage users. The main objective is to provide means for
            enhancing systems, services, and activities to create similar experiences to those experienced when playing
            games. Our goals are to create a reliable and easy way to achieve the objective described above.
            The FrontEnd side of the software is a control panel to add, modify, delete or create services, also you can
            see all the rewards that your customers have achieved over time, to se a top, export the rewards as .CSV
            file . This combined with the gamification service will let users 'choose' their own way of using our
            product.
            The BackEnd side of the software is the REST API creating to transfer data from server to website and from
            server to customer's website.

    <section>
        <h3 role="doc-subtitle">2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
        <p>The main user classes that are anticipated to use this service are website owners that are interested
            to add a gamification system for their customers. Being a service that someone can implement
            for himself, we predict a low use frequency. For all customers are offered the same security and privilege
            levels because in our eyes all users are equal.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3 role="doc-subtitle">2.4 Operating Environment</h3>
        <p>The operating environment in which the software will operate is any given web browser
            app that supports HTML 5. The hardware platform, operating system, and other requirements
            are given by the specific browser used. Our services can be invoked from any kind of website.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3 role="doc-subtitle">2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
        <p>The main limitations are given by the early stages of the project because of the lack of user data we are
            able to collect. This impedes the correctness and speed of our AI.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3 role="doc-subtitle">2.6 User Documentation</h3>
        <p>The public API route will be described on a WSDL.xml file that the customers will receive upon registration
            via email.
            WSDL.xml file will contain explicit data about our public API routes, how to use them properly.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3 role="doc-subtitle">2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
        <p>The main third-party services used by us come with some risk factors that we assume. One of
            them is relying on a server hosting service and any problems with it are out of our control.
            Another one is the storage space of the database which right now is not a problem, but risks
            rise with the number of users. We use microservices for login/register, for management services
            and for user progress, that for in case one services is down or has a problem, the other ones
            can still run perfectly.</p>

    <h2>3. External Interface Requirements</h2>
    <section>
        <h3 role="doc-subtitle">3.1 User Interfaces</h3>
        <p>
            The login interface welcomes the user and lets him log in. Register interface will also send an
            email with the WSDL.xml file needed for public API documentation. After that, the main page loads
            and from the index page you can go to control panel page. From this page you can add new service, modify
            a service, delete a service, create bonding for services, delete bonds, see and get rewards, see a top
            for customers. Login and register systems interact with the user's database and have specific interfaces.
            So do the control panel and all it's featured, having separated controllers for database.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3 role="doc-subtitle">3.2 Hardware Interfaces</h3>
        <p>The supported device types consist of all devices that support a browser, including those that view the
            website in mobile mode. The used communication protocol is HTTP and the data is transferred via JSON
            format.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3 role="doc-subtitle">3.3 Software Interfaces</h3>
        <p>The website will have an integrated commercial component so that the activity of the users
            will be monetised. Oracle with PL/SQL language will be used as an SQL database engine and the interactions
            with the
            database will be possible via a REST API. API will receive specific requests in JSON format,
            including register, login, create/delete/update services, rewards etc.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3 role="doc-subtitle">3.4 Communications Interfaces</h3>
        <p>HTTP will be used as a communication standard.
            As mentioned above, messages between server and client are manipulated in JSON format.
            Transfer rate depends on the hosting server and internet speed of the user. Download the rewards table
            also depends on the internet speed of the user.

            <h4 role="doc-subtitle">4.1.1 Description and Priority</h4>
            <p>Every user will be able to create their own services based on our options. They can implement
                gamification
                for almost every aspect of their website.

        <section>
            <h4 role="doc-subtitle">4.1.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences</h4>
            <p>For every user, we have a list of the services he created. Using it, we request
                information from the database to show on the control panel page. Every new service will have
            its own table in the database with the customers that did something to get a reward/experience.</p>

            <h4 role="doc-subtitle">4.1.3 Functional Requirements</h4>
            <p>
                Every service needs a name, a category, a milestone and the type of reward.
                Every customer can create bonded services. To create a bond service he needs to create a logical
                expression based on the existing services, using only AND/OR logical operator. We validate the
                expression and create a new service.

            <h3 role="doc-subtitle">5.3 Security Requirements</h3>
            <p>We secure our website by creating a unique hashcode for every customer who works like a JWT.
                Also, our data is secured because the customer needs to be logged in to access control panel page.
                Exporting the .CSV file is made on the personal computer. The email send at register with the WSDL.xml file
                and the hashcode is secured as well.</p>

            <p>
                GamS is a multipage website, every page having its HTML, CSS and JavaScript files that makes the cod
                easy to understand, open for improvement and expansion, and it's very easy to navigate on it and use
                the control panel page as a customer.
                The BackEnd server is made in Node.Js and organised on controllers and microservices. We created a REST API
                made in vanilla Node.js. We also used Nodemailer to send emails for quality of life improvement.
                Database is created in PL/SQL language making our server cleaner and easier to understand. It helped us and
                our website's complexity because of its technologies.
                We focus more on ease of learning but tried to focus on ease of use as well because both are important:
                learning new technologies for creating a website but also learning how to create an attractive and fully
                user interface and a great user experience on our website.
