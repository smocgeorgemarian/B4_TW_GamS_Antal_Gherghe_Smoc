            <h3 role="doc-subtitle">1.4 Product Scope</h3>
            <p>The software specified is a gamification service used by web developers and site owners to add rewards granted to users for doing specified tasks or actions and add a leveling system. The benefits of this service are on a marketing level to motivate and engage users. The main objective is to provide means for enhancing systems, services, and activities to create similar experiences to those experienced when playing games. Our goals are to create a reliable and easy way to achieve the objective described above.
                The FrontEnd side of the software is a replacement for other competitors like "Reddit", "Twitter", etc. which takes the best of each and creates a place where everybody can experience a new and exciting approach. This combined with the gamification service will let users 'choose' their own way of using our product.

            <h3 role="doc-subtitle">2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
            <p>The main user classes that are anticipated to use this product are young people, gamers, and people interested only in some specific categories we supply. Both the young people and gamer user classes are anticipated to use the service on a high frequency. The latter class is more prone to use the full extent of the gamification side than the first one, given the familiarity with the function. For the class containing people interested only in specific categories, we predict a low use frequency and a low possibility of entering communities other than the ones they are already part of. All classes are offered the same security and privilege levels because in our eyes all users are equal.</p>

            <h3 role="doc-subtitle">2.4 Operating Environment</h3>

            <h3 role="doc-subtitle">2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
            <p>The main limitations are given by the early stages of the project because of the lack of user data we are able to collect. This impedes the correctness and speed of our AI.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3 role="doc-subtitle">2.6 User Documentation</h3>
            <p>For the average user, there is no need for documentation given the easy-to-use interface and the familiarity given by other social apps.  For developers and site owners looking to use our gamification API, there will be a thorough documentation released with the final product.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3 role="doc-subtitle">2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
            <p>The main third-party services used by us come with some risk factors that we assume. One of them is relying on a server hosting service and any problems with it are out of our control. Another one is the storage space of the database which right now is not a problem, but risks rise with the number of users.</p>

        <h2>3. External Interface Requirements</h2>
        <section>
            <h3 role="doc-subtitle">3.1 User Interfaces</h3>
            <p>
                The login interface welcomes the user and lets him log in. Register interface redirects the user to the selection menu so that data about the user's preferences may be collected.  After the user's preferences are specified, the main page loads and the feed is given to the user. Interactions and engagement are used so that several badges are unlocked.
                Several settings are available to the user directly from the navigation bar available on the main page. A settings menu is available for advanced settings that personalise the user's experience.
                User interaction is made available via hovering over specific posts and consists of 3 types of reactions: like, comment and share.
                Comments that do not respect the community rules should be reported using the report button available for every post.
                Login and register systems interact with the user's database and have specific interfaces. So do the feed menu and the settings menu.

        <section>
            <h3 role="doc-subtitle">3.2 Hardware Interfaces</h3>
            <p>The supported device types consist of all devices that support a browser, including those that view the website in mobile mode. The used communication protocol is HTTPS and the data is transferred via JSON format.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3 role="doc-subtitle">3.3 Software Interfaces</h3>
            <p>The website will have an integrated commercial component so that the activity of the users will be monetised. SQLite will be used as an SQL database engine and the interactions with the database will be possible via a REST API. API will receive specific requests in JSON format, including register, login, get the time the user has spent on the website etc.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3 role="doc-subtitle">3.4 Communications Interfaces</h3>
            <p>HTTPS will be used as a communication standard. Register function also requires e-mail confirmation. Shareable data can be transmitted via a link on other social media apps. As mentioned above, messages between server and client are manipulated in JSON format. Transfer rate depends on the hosting server and internet speed of the user and it is optimised by using webp format for images and imposing a maximum resolution allowed for image posting actions.</p>

                <p>
                    GamS is a multi-page website, every page having its HTML, CSS and JavaScript files that makes the cod easy to understand, open for improvment and expansion, and it.s very easy to navigate on it as a customer.
                    We focus more on ease of learning but tried to focus on ease of use as well because both are important: learning new technologies for creating a website but also learning how to create an attractive and fully user interface and a great user experience on our website.
